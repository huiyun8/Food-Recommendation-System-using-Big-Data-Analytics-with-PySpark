# Food-Recommendation-using-Big-Data-Analytics-with-PySpark

With the increasing popularity of online food blogs, recipe websites, and social media, people have access to a vast array of recipes to choose from. However, it can be overwhelming to sift through countless recipes and choose one that matches their dietary preferences and available ingredients. To address this issue, we developed a recipe recommendation system that recommends recipes based on a user's ingredient list and dietary preferences.

The implemented system uses Apache Pyspark and big data analytics to process a large dataset of recipes and extract relevant features such as ingredients, dietary labels, and recipe ratings. We then employ machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and build a model that predicts which recipes will most likely appeal to a user based on their ingredient list and dietary preferences.
